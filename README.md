# FreshMart Data Pipeline

## Overview  
The **FreshMart Data Pipeline** is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates the end-to-end process of ingesting, transforming, and analyzing retail product data using Python and Pandas. The project is designed to simulate real-world data engineering workflows while keeping the structure simple and easy to follow.

---

## Objectives  
- Practice building a data pipeline from scratch.  
- Learn how to handle raw CSV data with Pandas.  
- Apply basic transformations such as filtering, grouping, and cleaning.  
- Generate insights from product data for analysis and reporting.  
- Build confidence in applying data engineering concepts in small projects.  

---

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is a mock CSV file:  

- **File Name:** `freshmart_products.csv`  
- **Columns:**  
  - ProductID  
  - ProductName  
  - Category  
  - Price  
  - StockQuantity  

---

## Pipeline Workflow  
1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.  

2. **Data Transformation**  
   - Clean missing or invalid data.  
   - Standardize column values.  
   - Apply transformations like grouping, filtering, and sorting.  

3. **Data Analysis**  
   - Generate descriptive statistics.  
   - Derive insights such as:  
     - Top categories by product count.  
     - Price distribution across products.  
     - Stock availability summaries.  

4. **Output**  
   - Save transformed datasets to new CSV files.  
   - Document analysis results for reporting.
